          <p class="end-paragraph">Hi, I'm David and I enjoy adventure.</p>
            <p class="end-paragraph">One of my favorite parts of life is getting outside of my comfort zone; the more scared I am, the better.</p>
          <p class="end-paragraph">How does this transfer to my work life? Simply put: I like to try new things and I will not quit on them until they are complete.</p>
            <p class="end-paragraph">Since I am never satisfied with my current level of knowledge, I am always learning and trying to better myself mentally, both with regards to my career and outside of it.</p>

          <p class="end-paragraph">I am a musician: an instrumentalist and a composer. I play guitar, piano, percussion, bass guitar, sing, and manipulate sound and tunes in many ways to produce music I find enjoyable.</p>
          <p class="end-paragraph">I have played in many groups and have a lot of experience both writing songs and performing. If I could do anything for the rest of my life, it would be singing for a band and traveling the world on tour.</p>

        <div class="col-right">
          <p>Most of the time, I like to travel out of the country. Including the USA, I have visited 17 countries plus Vatican City.</p>
          <p>Here is a brief summary of my journeys: </p>
          <p>The <strong>first</strong> was when I went to <em>Canada</em> (Toronto) as a child on a family trip, but I don't remember much aside from Niagra Falls. </p>
          <p>The <strong>second</strong> for 1 week in 2006 to <em>Ukraine</em> (Kiev). </p>
          <p>The <strong>third</strong> for 2 weeks in 2013 to <em>Italy</em> (Rome, Florence, Brixen), <em>Vatican City</em>, <em>Austria</em> (Innsbruck), and <em>Germany</em> (Munich). </p>
          <p>The <strong>fourth</strong> for 2 weeks in 2016 to <em>Sweden</em> (Stockholm), <em>Finland</em> (Helsinki), <em>Denmark</em> (Copenhagen), <em>Switzerland</em> (Geneva), <em>Norway</em> (Oslo), and back to <em>Sweden</em> (Stockholm).</p>
          <p>The <strong>fifth</strong> for 14 weeks in 2017 to <em>England</em> (London, Stonehenge, Oxford, Stratford-Upon-Avon), <em>Germany</em> (Berlin, Munich), <em>Spain</em> (Madrid), <em>Portugal</em> (Lisbon, Cabo da Roca), <em>Netherlands</em>            (Eindhoven, Enschede, Zwolle, Nijmegen, Amsterdam), <em>Belgium</em> (Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Brussels), <em>France</em> (Paris), <em>Germany</em> (Stuttgart), <em>Italy</em> (Milan, Angolo Terme: 1 month for WorkAway), <em>Germany</em> (Cologne),

        <div class="col-right">
          <p class="beg-paragraph">I have played soccer since i was 8. I still play in recreational leagues these days and I referee as a side job for fun. </p>
          <p>Soccer is also my favorite sport to watch. I mainly support the USA national team, but I also enjoy watching any quality teams play where I know the players - mostly the larger European teams. </p>
          <p>I have been a fan of Football my entire life, being a lifelong supporter of the Carolina Panthers and Florida Gators. </p>
          <p>For basketball: the Charlotte Hornets, Florida Gators, Duke Blue Devils, NC State Wolfpack, and my alma mater the UNC Charlotte 49ers. </p>
          <p>My other favorite sport to watch is hockey, with my team being the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
          <p>In baseball, I support my local Charlotte Knights who I have been going to see in person since I was young.  In the Major League, I support the Atlanta Braves.</p>
